⬛️Purpose:

⬛️Explanation:
1, ArchiveLog Mode

    #1, 03_ArchiveLog_001.png: To confirm the Database log mode is Archive Mode.
                               To acquire info of the redo log directory.
                               To distinguish the status of redo logs which is INACTIVE.

    #2, 03_ArchiveLog_002.png: To confirm the redo log files are there really.
                               To remove the redo log files, "redo01.log" and "redo03.log", because their status are INACTIVE.
                               To confirm the redo log files are removed really.

    #3, 03_ArchiveLog_003.png: Shutdown abort the database and startup then, Get ORA ERROR.
                                   ORA-03113: end-of-file on communication channel
                                   Process ID: 31932
                                   Session ID: 125 Serial number: 41450
                               Database startup failed.

    #4, 03_ArchiveLog_004.png: Exit the DB and login again, STARTUP MOUNT successfully.
                               Recovery the redo log files with the following commands:
                                   ALTER DATABASE CLEAR LOGFILE GROUP 1;
                                   ALTER DATABASE CLEAR LOGFILE GROUP 3;
                               The redo log files are recovered.

    #5, 03_ArchiveLog_005.png: The STATUS of both the new recovery redo log files are UNUSED.
                               The log mode is still ARCHIVELOG.
    
    #6, 03_ArchiveLog_006.png: Shutdown abort the db, then startup successfully.
                               One of the new recovery redo log files, it's STATUS is changed to CURRENT, 
                               which means it's under write in. The another is still UNUSED status.
                               Check the directory and redo log files are correct

2, NoArchiveLog Mode

    #1, 03_noArchiveLog_001.png: Check the log mode is NOARCHIVELOG.
                                 Distinguish the STATUS of redo log files which is INACTIVE.
                                 Find the corresponding target redo log files, "redo02.log" and "redo03.log".
                                 Remove the above redo log files, and make sure they're removed really. 

    #2, 03_noArchiveLog_002.png: Shutdown abort and startup, Get ORA ERROR.

                                 The redo log files are recovered.

    #4, 03_noArchiveLog_004.png: The new recovery redo log files are both UNUSED status. the log mode is NOARCHIVELOG.
                                 The database is startup successfully.

🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺The above are Deprecated🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺

⬛️Confirmed:
1, Under both the ArchiveLog and NoArchiveLog mode, the inactive redo log files are recovery successfully, and their sizes are identical to the origins.
2, DB startup normally in both ArchiveLog and NoArchiveLog mode, respectively.


⬛️Pending:
1, How to compare the contents of the recovery inactive redo log files with the origins.

2, Why the STATUS changed from INACTIVE to UNUSED.  => SOLVED
(Archived redo log recovery.)
=> [SOLVED]. When the redo log is new added, the status is UNUSED as default.

⬛️Thinking:
The DB backup is very very very important!!!

All Above.
Thank you for reading.
